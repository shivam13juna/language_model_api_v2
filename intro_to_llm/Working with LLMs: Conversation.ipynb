Pick one and I’ll help you with steps or tune the code.\\n\\n1) Guess the number (classic and quick)\\n- What it does: your friend (the computer) picks a number, and you try to guess it with hints.\\n- Code (paste into a Python file or a REPL):\\n\\nimport random\\n\\ndef guess_number():\\n    secret = random.randint(1, 100)\\n    attempts = 0\\n    while True:\\n        guess = input(\"Enter your guess (1-100): \")\\n        try:\\n            g = int(guess)\\n        except ValueError:\\n            print(\"Please enter a number.\")\\n            continue\\n        attempts += 1\\n        if g < secret:\\n            print(\"Too low!\")\\n        elif g > secret:\\n            print(\"Too high!\")\\n        else:\\n            print(f\"You got it in {attempts} tries!\")\\n            break\\n\\nguess_number()\\n\\n2) Mad Libs-style story generator\\n- What it does: makes a silly story using random words.\\n- Code:\\n\\nimport random\\n\\nnouns = [\"dragon\", \"robot\", \"cookie\", \"spaceship\"]\\nverbs = [\"jumps\", \"eats\", \"drifts\", \"zips\"]\\nadjectives = [\"shiny\", \"mysterious\", \"red\", \"gigantic\"]\\n\\nstory = (\\n    f\"Today I met a {random.choice(adjectives)} {random.choice(nouns)} \"\\n    f\"that loves to {random.choice(verbs)}.\"\\n)\\n\\nprint(story)\\n\\n3) Simple password generator\\n- What it does: creates a random password you can copy.\\n- Code:\\n\\nimport random, string\\n\\ndef password(length=12):\\n    chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\\n    return \\'\\'.join(random.choice(chars) for _ in range(length))\\n\\nprint(password())\\n\\n4) Dice roll simulator (great for a quick stats lesson)\\n- What it does: rolls a die many times and shows the distribution.\\n- Code:\\n\\nimport random\\n\\ncounts = {i: 0 for i in range(1, 7)}\\nfor _ in range(10000):\\n    counts[random.randint(1, 6)] += 1\\n\\nprint(counts)\\n\\n5) Tiny ASCII art rocket\\n- What it does: prints a little rocket using text.\\n- Code:\\n\\ndef rocket():\\n    print(\"   /\\\\\\\\\")\\n    print(\"  /  \\\\\\\\\")\\n    print(\" |====|\")\\n    print(\" |    |\")\\n    print(\" |____|\")\\n    print(\" /____\\\\\\\\\")\\nrocket()\\n\\nIf any of these spark your interest, tell me which one you’d like to run, and I’ll walk you through getting it to work or customizing it. Also, if you have any hobbies or topics you like (games, math, storytelling, data), I can tailor a fun Python mini-project just for you. What sounds good?'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Totally get it. If you’re bored, let’s do something chill and fun that doesn’t feel like a big project. Here are 3 quick ideas you can try in under 15 minutes. Pick one and I’ll walk you through it.\\n\\n1) Cool turtle art (visual and instant)\\n- What it is: a tiny drawing with Python’s built-in turtle module. It crawls around the screen in colors.\\n- Why it’s fun: instant visuals, no setup beyond Python.\\n- Start code (paste into a file or REPL):\\n\\nimport turtle\\nt = turtle.Turtle()\\nt.speed(0)\\nt.hideturtle()\\nscreen = turtle.Screen()\\nscreen.bgcolor(\"black\")\\ncolors = [\"red\",\"orange\",\"yellow\",\"green\",\"cyan\",\"blue\",\"violet\"]\\n\\nfor i in range(200):\\n    t.pencolor(colors[i % len(colors)])\\n    t.forward(i)\\n    t.right(91)\\n\\nturtle.done()\\n\\n2) Quick fortune-teller (humor with random picks)\\n- What it is: a tiny console “fortune cookie” that spits out a silly line.\\n- Why it’s fun: light, playful, and you don’t need any setup.\\n- Start code:\\n\\nimport random\\n\\nfortunes = [\\n    \"A snack will appear when you least expect it.\",\\n    \"Your next idea will be awesome (or at least interesting).\",\\n    \"A friendly challenge is coming your way—embrace it.\",\\n    \"Take a break; your brain will thank you.\",\\n    \"Somewhere a cat is plotting your next great idea.\"\\n]\\n\\nprint(\"Bored o\\'clock fortune:\")\\nprint(random.choice(fortunes))\\n\\n3) Quick ASCII art doodle (text-only fun)\\n- What it is: prints a tiny ASCII rocket or shape to the terminal.\\n- Why it’s fun: no graphics needed, just runner-friendly.\\n- Start code:\\n\\ndef rocket():\\n    print(\"   /\\\\\\\\\")\\n    print(\"  /  \\\\\\\\\")\\n    print(\" |====|\")\\n    print(\" |    |\")\\n    print(\" |____|\")\\n    print(\" /____\\\\\\\\\")\\nrocket()\\n\\nIf you tell me which one sounds the most fun, I’ll tailor it a bit (e.g., change colors, add prompts, or make it a tiny game) and walk you through running it step-by-step. What do you feel like trying?'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Fair enough—going out and partying isn’t always the vibe. Here are a few quick, low-effort ideas that can be fun in under 15 minutes, solo or with a friend:\\n\\n- 15-minute dance party: put on a favorite playlist and just move. Bonus points for a goofy 30-second dance clip you keep or share.\\n- Mini photo scavenger hunt: look for 5 interesting things around you, snap quick pics, and maybe make a tiny collage or a story from them.\\n- Quick social game: text a friend “Two truths and a lie” or “20 questions.” Easy to start, and you get some laughs without much setup.\\n- Micro story or joke burst: write a tiny 50–100 word story or a string of 5 quick jokes about something you like.\\n- Fast snack hack: something simple and tasty you can whip up in a few minutes (like toast with toppings, yogurt parfait, or a fruit smoothie).\\n- Tiny creative doodle: draw a short, silly ASCII art or doodle a rocket in 5 minutes.\\n\\nIf you’re up for a small coding detour, we can build something super quick (a random compliment generator, a tiny fortune teller, or a simple ASCII art loop) in just a few minutes too.\\n\\nTell me which vibe you want—outdoors, social, or cozy at home—and any interests you have (games, music, movies, snacks). I’ll tailor a quick, fun shout-out plan for you.'}]"
