    "Did you know? In Python, `**` in a function call means **“take this mapping (usually a dict) and expand it into keyword arguments.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s happening in your call\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add_something(**{\"a\": 7, \"b\": 12})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python sees a dict with keys `\"a\"` and `\"b\"`, and expands it as if you had written:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add_something(a=7, b=12)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So it’s not passing the dict as a single argument. It’s **unpacking** it into named parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Because your function is defined with parameter names `a` and `b`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_something(a, b):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "…and the dict has matching keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\"a\": 7, \"b\": 12}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So `a` gets `7`, `b` gets `12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules (the important bits)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keys must be strings** (valid keyword names, effectively):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   add_something(**{1: 7, 2: 12})  # TypeError\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keys must match parameter names**, unless the function accepts arbitrary keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   add_something(**{\"x\": 7, \"b\": 12})\n",
    "   # TypeError: got an unexpected keyword argument 'x'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can mix normal args + `**` (but don’t give the same value twice):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   add_something(7, **{\"b\": 12})      # ok -> a=7, b=12\n",
    "   add_something(a=7, **{\"a\": 9})     # TypeError: multiple values for 'a'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can also merge multiple `**` expansions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   add_something(**{\"a\": 7}, **{\"b\": 12})\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Related: `*` vs `**`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `*` unpacks a sequence into **positional arguments**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  add_something(*[7, 12])   # same as add_something(7, 12)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `**` unpacks a mapping into **keyword arguments**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  add_something(**{\"a\": 7, \"b\": 12})  # same as add_something(a=7, b=12)\n",
    "  ```\n",
